<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My background is in Data Science and analytics, and I am pivoting to executing my ideas into applications to solve real world problems.</p>

<p>I've worked in multi-national companies for 10 years, developing reporting frameworks with visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI, automating processes
  and ETL pipelines with Python and SQL, and forecasting with Machine Learning models. 
</p>

<p>I enjoy being as close to the 'ground' level of the business or problem as possible, which is why I'm on this path to create products that can provide
  information and solutions for users in a simple and effective way.
